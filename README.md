## 🚨 The Problem

Running a shop in Ghana is hard. Most shop owners face the following challenges:

* ❌ **No inventory tracking** – They don’t know what’s in stock or what’s finished
* ❌ **No sales data or daily reports** – Everything is based on memory or guesswork
* ❌ **Manual processes** – Owners still use notebooks for stock and sales
* ❌ **Slow customer service** – Long queues due to slow manual selling
* ❌ **Expensive ERP & POS systems** – Most require computers, paid licenses, and networking
* ❌ **Too complex** – Many ERP systems are hard to set up and use, especially for small shops
